## Why Use a Template?
- Beginners often place holes too close together or too far apart
- A template eliminates guesswork and provide consistent, arch-shaped patterns every time.
## Ideal Hole Spacing
- Baseline spacing: ~5 mm between holes.
- However, always verify this spacing against the patient's actual dental arch before punching, and adjust spacing accordingly.
## When Hole Spacing are Wrong
### Too Close Together
- Dam overstretches → increased risk of tearing.
- Papilla exposure or trauma due to dam slipping mesially/distally.
- Poor fit around cervical margins → leakage into the field.
### Too Far Apart
- The "Tent Effect" — the sheet bunches up or forms tent-like folds between the teeth
	- Excess material obstructs the operator's view and interferes with instrument access
- Awkward flossing due to material bulk between contacts.
- Poor soft tissue retraction, which is one of the main benefits of using a rubber dam
## Hole Positioning
- The rubber dam sheet should rest below the patient's nose, leaving the nostrils unobstructed for easy breathing.
### Using a Template
- Center the template on the rubber dam sheet—it's pre-designed for ideal positioning of both maxillary and mandibular arches.
- Consider keeping a few pre-marked dam sheets ready for clinical efficiency.
### Manual Marking (Without a Template)
- Maxillary arch: Mark the upper central incisors about 2.5 cm (1 inch) from the top edge, centered horizontally.
- Mandibular arch:  Place the first molar hole roughly halfway down the height of the sheet and one-third in from the side.
 - This placement provides enough material to cover the upper lip while also keeping the nose uncovered.
 
 - Maintain 5 mm spacing between hole centers.
## Managing Malpositioned or Crowded Teeth
- Templates assume ideal arch form which works well for typical cases
- However, some cases requires customization.
### Adjusting for Misaligned or Crowded Teeth
- Start by marking the ideal arch form as if the teeth were perfectly aligned.
- Then, identify any misaligned or rotated teeth that don't match the standard arch.
- For each misaligned tooth, add a new mark next to the original to reflect its actual position in the mouth.
- Use the new, corrected marks for punching, and ignore the original reference marks for those teeth.
### Direct Positioning Technique:
- When significant variations are needed
- Place the rubber dam sheet over the patient's teeth.
- Mark correct hole positions directly on the dam
