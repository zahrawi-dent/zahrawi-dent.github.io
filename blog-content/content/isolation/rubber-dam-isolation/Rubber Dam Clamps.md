- The Clamp is used to anchor the sheet to the most posterior tooth being isolated.
- They are also used to retract gingival tissue.
## Types
### Based on Material
- Metallic Clamps:
	- Durable and the standard choice
- Nonmetallic (Soft) Clamps:
	- Often used on ceramic crowns to reduce the risk of damage
	- They are radiolucent– allowing taking X-rays without removing the dam
### Based on Design
- Winged Clamps
	 - The wings help retract the rubber dam away from the operating field, improving visibility and access.
	- Enable the one-step (all-in-one) placement technique where clamp and dam are applied simultaneously
- Wingless Clamps
	- Identified by the "W" prefix in their numbering system (e.g., W8A)
### Based on Function
- Passive Clamps:
	- Primarily serve to hold the rubber dam in place with minimal pressure.
	- Preferred when gingival retraction is not required, helping preserve soft tissue health.
- Active Clamps:
	- Their prongs are gingivally directed
	- Ideal for: Partially erupted teeth, when needing extra soft gingival tissue retraction
## Clamp Components
- The clamp consists of
	- Four prongs that contact the tooth surface
	- Two jaws that grip the tooth
	- A bow connecting the jaws
- The winged clamp has anterior and lateral wings
## Clamp Selection Principles
### Key Selection Guidelines
- Rubber dam clamps are not strictly categorized by tooth class (molar clamps vs. premolar clamps)
- Instead they come in different shapes designed to match various cervical morphologies
- Selection should be based on individual tooth anatomy rather than just tooth class
- Always assess the shape between clamp jaws and determine if it corresponds with the cervical anatomy of the tooth 
- Always test clamp fit and stability before placing the dam. If the clamp rocks or slides, try a different size or shape.
### Rule of Four
- Optimal clamp stability requires four-point contact between clamp and tooth surface
- Three-point contact (particularly two distal points) may provide adequate stability but requires careful consideration of tipping forces from the rubber dam
## Recommended Clamps by Tooth Type
- There are not specific clamps for molars or premolars;
	- there are only different shapes to coincide with different cervical morphologies.
	- The suggestions provided are general guidelines.
### Anterior Teeth 
- Generally do not require clamps as the dam can be stabilized with floss or ligatures
- **Exception**: Class V restorations near the gumline require specialized clamps
- **Recommended**: No. 212SA (butterfly clamp) for cervical retainer applications
### Premolars
- Winged Options
	- No. 2A (winged): Standard choice, though sometimes slightly unstable
	- Suitable for both premolars and some second molars
- Wingless Options
	- No. W2A (wingless):
### Molars
- Winged Options
	- No. 8A or 27
	- Designed for mandibular right teeth but work well for maxillary left teeth
	- Mirror designs available for mandibular left teeth, suitable for maxillary right teeth
- Wingless Options
	- No. W8A, W8ASA, or B1 (wingless clamps)
	- Various sizes available for different molar dimensions
### Supplemental Clamps for Special Situations
- Partially Erupted Molars
	- No. W14A (wingless)
	- No. 14A (winged)
- Premolars with Subgingival Margins
	- No. W1A (wingless)
	- No. 1A (winged)
- Mandibular Incisors and Small Teeth
	- No. W0 (wingless)
	- No. 00 (winged)
### Asymmetric clamps
- Some clamps are asymmetric (one jaw broader than the other) to suit unique situations like:
	- Tooth rotation
    - Uneven tissue levels on buccal vs. lingual
- Clamp 12A has a broader buccal jaw (ideal for mandibular right teeth).
- Clamp 13A is its mirror image, with a broader lingual jaw (better for mandibular left or rotated teeth).
## Safety Precautions
- Expand the clamp only enough to pass over the facial and lingual heights of contour.
	- Over-expanded clamps lose gripping strength and are more likely to become dislodged
	 - Discard over-expanded clamps rather than risk clinical failure
 
- The clamp (except No. 212, which is placed after the dam) must be tied with 30 cm of dental floss before insertion.
	- For added safety, floss can be threaded through both jaws of the clamp
	- This precaution allows easy retrieval if the clamp dislodges, breaks, or is swallowed/aspirated during use.
## Clamp Placement Guidelines
- Clamp jaws should contact the tooth at four line angles for optimal stability
- Clamps aren't expected to fit teeth precisely - proper contact at line angles is sufficient
	- The clamp role is to hold the dam in place not providing a tight seal around the tooth

- Jaws should not extend beyond mesial and distal line angles to avoid interference with matrix and wedge placement

- Cross-arch compatibility exists - mandibular clamps can work for maxillary teeth and vice versa
- Second molars often have variable cervical shapes, making premolar clamps sometimes ideal

- If needed, you can customize a clamp by reshaping the jaws using a mounted stone when standard shapes don't match tooth contour
