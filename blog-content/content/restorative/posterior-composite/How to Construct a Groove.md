- Grooves can be constructed by buildup, subtraction, or by both in alternation.
### The Buildup Method
- This technique builds grooves by creating adjacent ridges.

- Place and cure the first composite ridge.
- Build the adjacent ridge by placing a new increment of composite directly against the cured one.
- Using a condenser or a brush slightly moistened with a resin modeling agent, gently compress and adapt the new increment, pushing it toward the first one to form a natural-looking groove between them.
### Subtractive Method
- This technique sculpts a groove into a single, larger increment of uncured composite.

- Using the pointed end of a modeling instrument, sculpt the groove by starting from the central fossa and moving outward toward the periphery.
	- The instrument should slide gently, following the intended path of the groove until it joins the peripheral anatomy.
- This center-to-periphery sculpting direction is critical. If sculpting occurs from the periphery inward, the instrument will pull composite **away** from the restorative margin, creating a gap at the sensitive tooth-restoration interface.

- Grooves sculpted via the subtractive method can appear rough.
	- A brush slightly moistened with a resin modeling agent can be used to smooth any irregularities and ensure the composite is well-adapted at the margins.

- Avoid creating overly deep or sharp grooves. While anatomically tempting, they are difficult to polish, can promote the buildup of food and bacteria, and inhibit proper oral hygiene.
