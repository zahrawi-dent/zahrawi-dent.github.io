- Used for placement and removal of the clamp from the tooth.
	- They allow the operator to securely open the clamp, position it over the tooth, and then release it with control.
	
- Avoid forceps with deep grooves at the tips, as these can lock too tightly into the clamp holes, making removal difficult once the clamp is seated.
	- Ensure tips are **smooth and appropriately shaped** to prevent complications during clamp removal.
## Types
### IV-Type or Lightweight Forceps
- Preferred over traditional Palmer or Brewer designs due to:
	- Greater mechanical advantage: The fulcrum is positioned closer to the clamp, requiring less effort to open the jaws.
	- Horizontal terminal surfaces: Fit more securely into the clamp holes, minimizing clamp tilting or rotation during placement.
	- Particularly helpful for placing clamps on posterior or difficult-to-access teeth.
- Anti-rotation terminals: Unique to IV-type forceps, these features help maintain the correct orientation of the clamp, improving accuracy and safety during placement.
### Palmer and Brewer Forceps
- May have rounded or angled terminals that increase the risk of clamp instability during insertion.
- Lack anti-rotation design, making them less ideal for posterior access or delicate placements.
