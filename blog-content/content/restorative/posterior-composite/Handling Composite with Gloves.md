- Sometimes you'll need to handle composite with gloves (e.g., to form the increment into a ball)
- Composite should only be handled when wearing powder-free nitrile or latex gloves. 
- Handling composite using powdered gloves, even if uncontaminated by blood and saliva, detracts from the mechanical properties of the composite and must be avoided.
- Never handle composite with powdered gloves.
	- The powder particles can become incorporated into the material, significantly detracting from its mechanical properties and compromising the longevity of the restoration.
	- This holds true even if the gloves are otherwise clean and uncontaminated by blood or saliva.
