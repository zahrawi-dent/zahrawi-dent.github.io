- Used to create holes in the rubber dam sheet for isolating individual teeth.
- Features a rotating metal disc (table) with five or six holes of varying sizes.
- A sharp, tapered plunger aligns with the selected hole to perforate the dam.
### Rubber Dam Hole Sizes
- Recommended Hole Sizes for Heavy Latex Dams:
- Size 5: Molars that will be clamped (anchor molars).
- Size 4: Other molars.
- Size 3: Premolars, canines, and maxillary central incisors.
- Size 2: Maxillary lateral incisors.
- Size 1: Mandibular incisors.

- Adjust hole sizes based on tooth dimensions, operator preference, dam thickness, or material type.
### Punching Tips
- Punch the dam after it is mounted on the frame (especially for beginners) — this stretches the dam and improves hole positioning.
- Center the plunger accurately over the cutting hole to avoid damaging the hole’s edges.
- Inspect the punch disc regularly — worn or damaged holes reduce cutting quality.
- Incomplete perforations can cause:
	- Tearing during dam placement
	- Inadequate seal around the tooth
- Do not punch holes for missing teeth — skipping them maintains dam tension and improves isolation by preventing gaps and fluid leakage.
### Punching with Templates
- When using templates or pre-marked dams:
	- For Class V restorations, punch the hole ~1 mm facial to the marked position for retraction with a No. 212SA clamp.
	- Modify hole positions to accommodate atypically aligned teeth or rotations.
