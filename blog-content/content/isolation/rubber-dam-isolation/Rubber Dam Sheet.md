### Thickness
- Rubber dam sheets are available in various thicknesses, including thin, medium, heavy, extra heavy, and special heavy.
- Heavy dams are not more challenging to apply than thinner ones, but they do have distinct advantages:
- **Greater durability**: Heavy dams are less likely to tear
- **Better seal and tissue retraction**: Heavy dams provide a more effective seal around the teeth and retract the gingival tissues more efficiently.
	- This is especially beneficial in Class V restorations, where a cervical clamp is often used in conjunction with the rubber dam to apically flatten soft tissues and improve access.
- Medium dams are ideal for situations where insertion is difficult due to tight proximal contacts or when the proximal contacts are broad and tooth mobility is limited.
### Color
- Green and blue are preferred because they provide good contrast with the surroundings.
- Green and blue are the most commonly preferred colors, as they provide excellent contrast against the surrounding tissues, enhancing visibility.
	- They are also considered soothing colors for the eyes, which helps reduce strain during prolonged procedures.
- The rubber dam sheet has two sides: a shiny side and a dull side.
	- The dull side should face the operator to minimize light reflection
### Size
- available in 5’’ × 5’’ or 6’’ × 6’’ inch square sheets. (12.5 × 12.5 cm or 15  × 15 cm²)
- Rubber dam sheets are available in: 5" × 5" (12.5 × 12.5 cm) and 6" × 6" (15 × 15 cm).
- The 6" × 6" size is typically used for isolation of posterior teeth in permanent dentition.
- The 5" × 5" size is often used for primary dentition or anterior teeth.
### Material
- The most popular material is latex, which offers flexibility and durability.
- However, some patients are allergic to latex, so it’s important to have latex-free alternatives available, such as polyisoprene or vinyl.
### Shelf Life
- Rubber dam materials, both latex and non-latex, deteriorate over time, which can result in decreased tear resistance.
- As the material approaches its expiration date, it becomes brittle and tears more easily.
- To check if the rubber dam material has passed it's shelf life, perform a tear test by attempting to tear a sheet with your thumb and index finger.
	- A new or good-quality rubber dam should be difficult to tear.
	- If the material is brittle and tears easily, it may be past its shelf life.
