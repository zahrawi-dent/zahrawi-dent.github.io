- The additive, or "buildup," modeling technique always begins with the construction of a triangular ridge, the fundamental building block of cusp anatomy.

- **Placement:** An initial increment of composite is formed into a ball and placed precisely at the starting point of the reconstruction, typically against the residual tooth structure.
- **Initial Shaping:** Using the flat face of a modeling spatula resting on the remaining ridge of the tooth, the composite ball is shaped first mesially, then distally.
	- This action transforms the ball into the pyramid-like shape of a triangular ridge.
- **Refinement:** Once the basic pyramid form is established, a sculpting instrument is used to refine the morphology and remove any excess composite before curing.
