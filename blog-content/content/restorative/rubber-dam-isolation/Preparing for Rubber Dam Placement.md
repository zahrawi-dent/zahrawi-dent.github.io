## Pre-Placement Checks
### Remove Calculus
- Examine the teeth for any calculus and remove them before placing the rubber dam, especially near the treatment area.
- Calculus deposits can prevent the dam from seating correctly, leading to leakage or tearing.
### Check for Sharp Edges & Overhangs
- Floss between the teeth to detect any sharp edges or overhanging restorations that could tear the dam during placement
- Smooth these areas as needed—for example, by using interproximal finishing strips or disks.
### Assess Proximal Contact Tightness
- Gently pass floss obliquely (from the buccal or lingual) through the contacts. This technique prevents the floss from forcefully snapping down and traumatizing the gingiva.
- **For tight contacts**: Consider using a medium-thickness dam instead of a heavy one for easier passage.
- **For extremely tight contacts**: 
- When flossing proves difficult, place a wedge to create slight separation before attempting to place the dam.
## Occlusal Considerations
- Mark maximum intercuspation contacts with articulating paper before rubber dam application when the procedure involves occlusal surfaces
- To preserve these markings during the procedure,apply and light-cure a thin layer of clear bonding agent or varnish over the marks.
## Administration of local anesthetics	
- Local anesthesia is administered before placing the rubber dam.
	- Profound anesthesia is typically achieved while you are placing the dam.
- When the points of the clamp's jaw are firmly on the tooth and have not penetrated gingival tissue (passive clamps), the patient may experience slight pressure discomfort.
	- This feeling usually subsides within a minute due to "pressure anesthesia", making infiltration anesthesia for gingival tissue unnecessary.
- If additional gingival comfort is needed, applying a topical anesthetic gel is often sufficient.
