## Indications
### Direct Restorations
- Composite is the material of choice for most direct restorations in the modern dental practice.

- For posterior teeth:
	- Composites offer a more conservative preparation than amalgam (preserving more tooth structure) and superior esthetics.
	- Modern composites have excellent wear resistance and strength, making them suitable for load-bearing areas in small-to-moderately sized restorations.
- For anterior teeth:
	- Composite is the ideal material for restoring interproximal cavities (Class III) and fractures involving the incisal edge (Class IV) due to its ability to mimic the color, translucency, and texture of natural enamel and dentin.
### Sealants and preventive resin restorations (PRRs)
- Sealants are applied to pits and fissures of caries-prone teeth to prevent decay.
- PRRs involve minimally invasive composite placement in early carious lesions to arrest progression while preserving tooth structure.
### Foundations and Core Buildups
 - When a tooth has lost significant structure but requires a crown, composite is used to build the tooth back up to an ideal shape (a "core").
 - Its ability to bond to the remaining tooth structure strengthens the entire unit, and its immediate hardness allows for crown preparation in the same appointment.
 - A tooth-colored core also prevents the metal color of an amalgam core from showing through an all-ceramic crown.
### Esthetic Enhancement Procedures:
- **Partial and Full Veneers:** A layer of composite can be sculpted directly onto the facial surface of a tooth to correct its shape, size, or color. This is a less invasive and more cost-effective alternative to porcelain veneers, though it may not last as long or resist staining as well.
- **Tooth Contour Modifications:** Composites can be used to reshape malformed teeth (e.g., peg laterals), repair chips, or lengthen worn incisal edges, dramatically improving a patient's smile in a single visit.
- **Diastema closure:** The material is added to the mesial surfaces of the adjacent teeth to close the space while maintaining natural proportions and emergence profiles.
### Repair of Existing Restorations
- Direct composites can be used to repair chipped or fractured composite or ceramic restorations, extending their lifespan.
### Periodontal Splinting
- Stabilize mobile teeth caused by periodontal disease by bonding them together with a fiber-reinforced composite splint on the lingual surfaces.
## Contraindications
### Inability to Obtain Adequate Isolation
- Proper isolation, typically using a rubber dam or other moisture control techniques, is critical for successful bonding.
- Composite or any other bonded material should not be used if the operating site cannot be adequately isolated from saliva, blood, or gingival crevicular fluid
- Poor isolation results in a weak or non-existent bond, microleakage, post-operative sensitivity, marginal staining, secondary caries, and ultimately, the failure of the restoration.
### Extension of the restoration onto the root surface:
- Composite restorations that extend significantly onto the root surface may have compromised marginal integrity.
- The bond to enamel is predictable and strong, but the bond to dentin and cementum on the root is less reliable and can degrade over time
- Â Furthermore, achieving adequate moisture control at or below the gumline is difficult.
- This can lead to marginal leakage and recurrent decay at the most difficult-to-access part of the restoration.
### Operator factors:
- Composite restoration is a technique-sensitive procedure. The operator must be committed to meticulous technique and attention to detail throughout the entire process

- Rushing or cutting corners in any of the following areas will compromise the final result:
- **Achieving proper isolation**: Ensuring a dry, contamination-free field throughout the procedure.
- **Precise material handling**: Properly layering, curing, and contouring the composite to avoid voids, overhangs, or inadequate polymerization.
- **Adherence to bonding protocols**: Correct application of adhesive systems to achieve a strong, durable bond.
- Careful finishing and polishing to create smooth margins and a plaque-resistant surface.
- **Time and skill commitment**: Inadequate training or rushing the procedure can lead to suboptimal results, such as poor marginal adaptation or esthetic outcomes.
### Parafunctional habits:
- Patients with severe bruxism or clenching habits may place excessive stress on composite restorations, leading to fracture, wear, or debonding, particularly in posterior teeth.
### Large restorations in high-load areas:
- Composites may not be suitable for extensive restorations in posterior teeth subjected to heavy occlusal forces, where indirect restorations (e.g., ceramic or metal) may provide better durability.
- However, composites can be used in such cases for economical considerations
### High caries risk or poor oral hygiene:
- While poor oral hygiene is a risk factor for any restoration, composite margins can be more susceptible to plaque accumulation and secondary caries if not perfectly finished and polished.
- A patient who is unwilling or unable to maintain good oral hygiene is at a high risk for failure of any adhesive restoration.
