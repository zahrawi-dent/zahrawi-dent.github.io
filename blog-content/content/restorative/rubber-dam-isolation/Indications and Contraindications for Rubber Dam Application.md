## ✅ Indications
### Endodontic Treatment
- The rubber dam prevents bacterial contamination of the root canal system from the oral environment. 
- It protects from ingesting or aspirating small instruments, such as hand files that could be accidentally dropped into the oral cavity or a bur breaking unexpectedly.
- It shields soft tissue and the tongue from irritating or distasteful medicaments (e.g., irrigants).
### Deep Caries Removal & Pulp Capping
- Maintaining asepsis is crucial when managing deep carious lesions close to the pulp.
- If pulp exposure occurs, a dry and uncontaminated field dramatically increases the success rate of pulp capping
### Subgingival and Cervical Restorations
- It provides retraction of the gingival tissue, improving visibility and access to subgingival or cervical areas of the tooth
- Especially helpful in Class V restorations.
### Adhesive Procedures
- Successful adhesion to tooth structure is highly sensitive to moisture and contamination
- The presence of saliva, blood, or other oral fluid significantly compromises bond strength, increasing the risk of clinical failure (e.g., marginal leakage or recurrent caries)
- A dry field is essential for predictable bonding outcomes.
### In high-risk patients:
- It helps protect the dental team and the dental office surfaces by acting as a barrier against spread of infectious agents that the patient may carry (e.g., In patients with hepatitis B or HIV)
### Bleaching:
- **Safety:** Preventing painful chemical burns to soft tissue
- **Efficacy:** Ensuring the bleaching gel works at its full potential for the best possible results.
- **Comfort:** Preventing the patient from tasting or swallowing the unpleasant gel.
## ❌ Contraindications
- Cases where placing a rubber dam are very rare and these cases are the exception
	- Most challenges can be overcome with technique and adaptation.

- Asthmatic patients 
- Patients with severe psychological disorders
	- May not tolerate isolation.
- Allergy to latex
	- Use Latex-free rubber dam materials (e,g, Polyisoprene, Vinyl).
- Mouth breathers or nasal obstruction
- Extremely malpositioned tooth
- Partially erupted teeth that can't sufficiently support a retainer
	- serrated or active clamps may help
