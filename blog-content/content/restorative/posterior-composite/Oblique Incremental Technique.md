## Rationale
- To minimize the adverse effects of high C-factor conditions, composite material must be applied in oblique increments that leave unbonded walls, avoiding simultaneous contact with more than two cavity walls.
- By leaving other walls unbonded during the curing of each increment, the composite has a free surface to shrink towards, reducing internal stress.
## Placement Principles
- **Increment Thickness:** Each layer should not exceed 2 mm in thickness to guarantee adequate light penetration and complete curing at the base of the increment.
- **Material Adaptation:** Composite should be placed by pressing or condensing firmly against cavity surfaces, with no gaps left behind
	- Avoid wiping or dragging the material, as the composite this can cause it to pull away from the cavity walls, creating voids at the tooth-restoration interface
## Step-by-Step Sequence
- **The Initial Dentin Increment:** Using an opaque dentin shade, apply the first increment obliquely, connecting the pulpal floor to the buccal or lingual wall
- **Building the Dentin Core:** Place subsequent increments against the opposing wall, the pulpal floor, and the previously cured layer. 
	- Continue this alternating, oblique placement, ensuring no single uncured increment connects opposing tooth walls (e.g., buccal and lingual) simultaneously.
- **Creating Space for the Enamel Layer:** Cease building the dentin core approximately 1.5-2mm short of the final cavosurface margins.
	- This step reserves the necessary volume for the final enamel layer, allowing for the creation of natural translucency and sculpting of the occlusal anatomy.
## Reinforcing Undermined Enamel
 - If regions of undermined enamel exists, they must be filled first and correctly light-cured
 - The initial polymerization can be done by directing the curing light through the surrounding tooth structure (e.g., from the buccal or lingual). This attenuates the light, causing a slower, more controlled initial polymerization, reducing the shrinkage stress
- The cure is then completed by directing the light from the occlusal surface to ensure full hardness.
