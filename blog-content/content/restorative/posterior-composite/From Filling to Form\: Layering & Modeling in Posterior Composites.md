- The placement of a posterior composite restoration involves two distinct phases: **layering** the material and **modeling** the anatomy.
## Layering Composite
- Layering involves incrementally placing and curing composite resin to fill the prepared cavity up to the final surface layer.
- The primary goal is to manage polymerization shrinkage and ensure a void-free restoration.

- The selection of a specific layering technique depends on:
- **Nature of the Composite Material:** The viscosity and curing properties of the composite influence how it's layered.
- **Cavity Size:** Larger cavities may require incremental layering to manage shrinkage and ensure proper curing.
- **Residual tooth Structure:** The remaining dentin and enamel guide the layering strategy to achieve a seamless integration
## Modeling Composite
- Various techniques can be employed to sculpt and recreate the occlusal surface for optimal:
- Form: The overall shape and contour of the tooth
- Anatomy: The detailed cusps, grooves, and ridges.
- Function: the ability to withstand occlusal forces and align with the patient's bite
### Requirements for Accurate Modeling
- To model effectively, a clinician must possess:
- **A Solid Understanding of Occlusal Anatomy:**
	- Comprehensive knowledge of the location and function of cusps, fossae, primary and secondary grooves, and triangular ridges.
- **The Skill of Anatomical Interpolation:**
	- Practitioners must interpret the residual anatomy—the remaining tooth structure to logically and seamlessly recreate the missing anatomy.
	- For instance, if a cusp is partially intact, the dentist must infer its full shape from the existing structure.
- **Perception of Fine Anatomical Detail:**
	- A keen eye for observing and replicating the subtle nuances that make a restoration look natural.
### Types of Modeling Techniques
- Stamping:
	-  Transfers occlusal anatomy directly onto the composite using a pre-made index or "stamp."
- Subtractive:
	- A slight excess of composite is applied, then sculpted away to define the occlusal surface before curing
- Additive:
	- Composite is built up incrementally, either cusp by cusp or simultaneously, to construct the anatomy from the ground up.
- There is no single modeling technique that suits every clinical scenario, clinical conditions will determine the choice
- These techniques are not mutually exclusive. A clinician may blend methods within a single restoration. 
	- For example, an additive approach can be used to establish the main cusps, followed by subtractive carving to refine secondary grooves and fossae.
	- This hybrid strategy often yields the most predictable and highly detailed anatomical results.
