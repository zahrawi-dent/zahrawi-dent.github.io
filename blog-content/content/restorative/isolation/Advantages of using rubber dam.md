# Advantages  of using rubber dam
- The dam eliminates saliva from the operating site and retracts  the soft tissue. Benefits to the clinician include: 
	- Constant retraction of the lips and tongue (clinician does not need to hold in place)
	- Easy analysis of the tissue to be treated (aided by contrast with the dam color) 
	- No noise from the aspirator (the patient can swallow) 
	- Less conversation with the patient 
	- Easier to treat by quadrant 
	- Optimum performance of bonding materials 
	- No contamination of the working field or adjacent tissues 
- Advantages for the patient include: 
	- No swallowing of instruments/materials 
	- Shorter working times 
	- Protection of the tongue, soft tissues, and perioral tissues
### Dry, Clean Operating Field 
- For most procedures, rubber dam isolation is the preferred method  of obtaining a dry, clean ield.
- he operator is best able to perform  procedures such as
	- proper tooth preparation,
	- caries removal,
	- and  insertion of restorative materials in a dry ield.
- he time saved by  operating in a clean field with good visibility may more than  compensate for the time spent applying the rubber dam.
- When  excavating a deep caries lesion and risking pulpal exposure, use of  the rubber dam is strongly recommended to prevent pulpal  contamination from bacteria in oral fluids. 
### Access and Visibility 
- he rubber dam provides maximal access and visibility.
- It controls  moisture and retracts soft tissue.
- Gingival tissue is mildly retracted  so as to enhance access to and visibility of the gingival aspects of  the tooth preparation.
- he dam also retracts the lips, cheeks, and  tongue.
- A dark-colored rubber dam provides a nonreflective  background, which is in contrast to the operating site.
### Optimization of Dental Material Propertiesï»¿ 
- he rubber dam prevents moisture contamination and compromise  of restorative materials used during the procedure.
- Amalgam restorative material does not achieve its optimum physical properties  if used in a wet field.
- Bonding to enamel and dentin is severely  compromised or nonexistent if the tooth substrate is contaminated  with saliva, blood, or other oral luids.
- Some studies have concluded that no diference exists between the use of the rubber dam  and cotton roll isolation as long as control of sources of contamination is maintained during the restorative procedures.
	- However,  the efectiveness of rubber dam isolation allows freedom to focus  on the details of the restorative procedure, which is especially  advantageous for those procedures that are technique sensitive. 
### Operating Efficiency 
- Conversation with the patient is limited.
- The rubber  dam retainer helps provide a moderate amount  of mouth opening during the procedure.
- Quadrant restorative procedures  are facilitated.
- Many state dental practice acts permit the assistant  to place the rubber dam, thus saving time for the dentist.
### Protection of the Patient and the Operator 
- It protects  the patient from aspirating or swallowing small instruments or  debris associated with operative procedures.
- A properly applied  rubber dam protects soft tissue and the tongue from irritating or  distasteful medicaments (e.g., etching and astringent agents).
- he  dam also ofers some soft tissue protection from rotating burs and  stones.
- Authors disagree on whether the rubber dam protects the  patient from mercury exposure during amalgam removal.
- it is generally agreed that the rubber dam is an efective  infection control barrier for the dental oice.
