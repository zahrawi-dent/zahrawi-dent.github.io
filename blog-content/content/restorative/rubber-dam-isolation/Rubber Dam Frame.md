- The frame supports the edges of the rubber dam sheet, keeping it stretched
- It can be placed beneath or above the sheet, it's a personal preference
## Types
### Metalic
- Durable and long-lasting
- Less bulky than plastic

 - Example: **Young’s Frame**: 
	 - A classic **U-shaped metal frame** with small projections to secure the edges of the dam
### Plastic
- Radiolucent, making them ideal when radiographs are needed (e.g., during endodontic treatment)
- Some designs are foldable, making it easier to adjust or move the frame when positioning radiographic sensors.
- Typically less durable and have a shorter lifespan than metal frames
